        XMPP according to wikipedia is an open communication protocol based on XML designed for instant messaging, presence information, and contact list maintenance.
   </p>
   <p>
        For a detailed explanation visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP">here</a>.
   </p>
   <h2>XMPP vs mainstream platforms</h2>
   <p>
        Well I'm not here to explain what XMPP is, I'm here to explain why is much better than other communication platforms such as <a href="https://stallman.org/discord.html">discord</a>, <a href="https://stallman.org/whatsapp.html">whatsapp</a>, <a href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html">facebook messenger</a>, etc.
   </p>
   <p>
        First of all, almost every mainstream platform track you in a abusive way, for example discord collects the following data:
        <ul>
            <li>
                IP Address (Not the big thing)
            </li>
            <li>
                Device UUID (Why the fuck?)
            </li>
            <li>
                Account E-Mail (Necessary for their shitty login system)
            </li>
            <li>
                All your <span style="color: #f00;">Messages</span> (ðŸ’€)
            </li>
            <li>
                All your images
            </li>
            <li>
                Your call log
            </li>
            <li>
                E-Mails sent by discord
            </li>
        </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
        They confirm all of this in their <a href="https://discord.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
        And if all of that shit is NOT enough for you, they also collect a list of running processes.

   </p>
   <p>
        They also don't let you login if your email is not one of the most recognised such as gmail, yahoo, outlook, etc.
   </p>
   <p>
        All of this and a bunch of more reasons you should not use any mainstream communication platform if you care about your privacy, the others mentioned are even worse.
   </p>
   <h2>Why XMPP then?</h2>
   <p>
        On the XMPP side your messages will always keep in secret if you want so, you can even host your own xmpp server if you want but there are many public servers that you can use it for free!
   </p>
   <p>
        XMPP support different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">end-to-end encryption</a> methods such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMEMO">OMEMO</a>, <a href="https://www.openpgp.org/">OpenPGP</a> and Legacy OpenPGP (not recommended).
   </p>
   <p>
        That means even the server can read what you are sending the encryption and decryption keys are stored on you machine locally.
   </p>
   <p>
        XMPP is also lightweight, there is no unnecessary shit like the spyware mentioned before.
   </p>
   <p>
        XMPP support multiple clients.
   </p>
   <p>
        Those are the main reasons why XMPP is better and one of the best methods of private and descentralized communication.
